# sehqlr's Yi config

I decided that I'm going to take the plunge with Yi! I've got some wacky ideas
about new kinds of editors, and I think that the idea of a library editor works
really well with that. I also really like the idea of being able to use the 
best ideas from each editor and make one that fits well for me :)

The initial configuration is based in part on the [Vim Config post](https://yi-editor.github.io/pages/vim-config/)

One thing that I want to do right away is to have the ability to write buffers
directly into IPFS, and maybe even building in some Hakyll publishing support.
